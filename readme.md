BetterLua-Firefall
====

A python file to fetch the [BetterLua](https://github.com/Xuerian/Sublime-BetterLua) syntax file, the exposed Firefall API as JSON ([Thanks to Arkii](http://firefall.nyaasync.net/Apiii/live.php)), and merge them into one new syntax file.

A version of the modified syntax file is included with each push to this repository.

API functions are scoped support.function.vendor.lua.firefall - [BetterLua](https://github.com/Xuerian/Sublime-BetterLua) introduces more scopes that your theme can also support, see its readme. A theme with partial support for these scopes is included in [BetterLua](https://github.com/Xuerian/Sublime-BetterLua).

For instructions on building the modified syntax file, see [BetterLua](https://github.com/Xuerian/Sublime-BetterLua)'s readme.
